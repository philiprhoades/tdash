    <h1>Quick overview</h1>
    <p><b>tDash</b> was born with the intent of applying a <b>GoogleReader</b> like interface to <b>Twitter</b>.</p>
    <p>The main features of such an interface would be<ul>
      <li>the ability to mark tweets as <em>read</em>, and thus to narrow down the user's attention to tweets that are as yet unread.</li>
      <li>sort incoming tweets into nice folders automatically</li></ul></p>
    <p>To <b>read</b> tweets in tDash all that you will need, ideally, is just one key: the <b>SPACEBAR</b>. Pressing it will take you to the next unread message automatically.</p>
    <p>Apart from that there are many other keyboard shortcuts. Press '?" to list them or click <b>Keys</b> from the <b>More</b> menu.</p>
